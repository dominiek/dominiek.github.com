Rotate3Di is a jQuery Effect Plugin that enables "3D" isometric rotation and
animation using CSS transformations. This visual effect is currently supported
by WebKit/Safari and Firefox 3.1 and above. Functionality includes: setting or
animating to an arbitrary isometric rotation angle, as well as flipping,
unflipping, or toggling the flip state of an object.

In order to use the rotate3Di jQuery plugin, your web page will need to include
jQuery v1.2.6 or newer, the jQuery CSS Transform patch, and the rotate3Di
plugin itself — in that order — all provided in the download zip file:

<script type="text/javascript" src="rotate3Di-0.9/jquery-1.3.2.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="rotate3Di-0.9/jquery-css-transform.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="rotate3Di-0.9/rotate3di-0.9.js"></script>

Rotate3Di can then be used like other jQuery Effects:

$('#example-id').rotate3Di(180, 3000);

under both MIT and GPL licenses, just like jQuery.
